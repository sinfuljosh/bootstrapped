Bootstrap + Bootswatch + Font Awesome 3  + Newznab+



I decided if I'm going to do this I should do it right. 

I am integrating Bootstrap, Bootswatch for themes, and Font Awesome for better sprites. 

I have starting with a base theme that is similar in style to the defaul theme 
and will be testing hotswapping bootswatch css to see if the site maintains. 

For those interested. Here are some screenshots. Theres the main nav and sub nav. 
And when scrolling up the subnav attached to top. Also if desired the subnav manu can be 
setup for mouse over like the default is. 

Its also setup so that you can choose left menu and top menu in the same bootstrap theme and 
the site will adjust accordingly. 

For those that want to see.
